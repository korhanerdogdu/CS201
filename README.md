# CS 201 - Programming Fundamentals  


This repository contains my **homework submissions** for **CS 201 - Programming Fundamentals**, a core programming course at Sabancƒ± University.  
The course provided a comprehensive introduction to **C++ programming**, covering both procedural and object-oriented programming principles, fundamental data structures, and algorithms.  

The assignments in this repository reflect the step-by-step development of programming skills, problem-solving techniques, and software engineering practices using C++.

All assignments were developed and tested primarily using **VSCode** on macOS, reflecting my proficiency with this integrated development environment (IDE).

## üéØ Course Goals

‚úÖ Develop proficiency in **C++ syntax** and core programming constructs.  
‚úÖ Strengthen **problem-solving skills** using structured and modular programming.  
‚úÖ Learn **algorithmic thinking** and analyze the efficiency of solutions.  
‚úÖ Gain hands-on experience with **data structures** like arrays, vectors, structs, linked lists, and classes.  
‚úÖ Build and debug **real-world C++ programs** using good coding practices.

## üìö Course Topics

The course was structured to progressively introduce increasingly complex programming concepts:

- **Week 1:**  
  Introduction to programming languages, data representation (bits/bytes), identifiers, literals, variables, `cin` / `cout` I/O

- **Week 2:**  
  Basic data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`), arithmetic operations, operator precedence, writing a first C++ program

- **Week 3:**  
  Functions with/without return values, prototypes, parameter passing (by value / by reference)

- **Week 4:**  
  Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

- **Week 5-6:**  
  Loops (`while`, `for`, `do-while`), `char` type, string class

- **Week 7-8:**  
  Structs, enums, vectors/arrays, sequential & binary search, vector insert/delete

- **Week 9:**  
  Sorting (selection/insertion sort), algorithm complexity, vector of structs, matrix operations

- **Week 10:**  
  File I/O, console streams, input/output file streams, string streams

- **Week 11-12:**  
  Classes and objects ‚Äî using and modifying classes like `Dice`, `RandGen`, `Date`

- **Week 13:**  
  Recursion

- **Week 14:**  
  Pointers, linked lists
